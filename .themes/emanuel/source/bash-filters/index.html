    <h3>What is a filter?</h3>
    <div id='what-is-a-filter'>
        A filter takes in information and trasforms it in some way to give
        helpful output. Input is usually taken from stdin and printed to stdout,
        but we can use file redirection or pipes (<code>|</code>) to change
        where input comes from and where output goes.<br /><br />

        To learn how to use a filter (or to find its options), read the man
        pages or <em>google it!</em><br /><br />

        Much of this page is similar to
        <a href='http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs2041/13s2/'>Andrew Taylor's
        COMP2041 course content</a>, as I thought the way in which Andrew
        taught the filters was excellent.

    <h3><code>cat</code></h3>
    <div id='cat'>
        We met cat briefly in the vim module. For a boring filter, it has some
        great tools:
        <table class='table table-bordered table-striped'>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    -n<br />
                    --number
                </td>
                <td>
                    Displays line numbers next to each printed line
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    -s<br />
                    --squeeze-blank
                </td>
                <td>
                    Squeeze blank lines: consecutive blank lines are squeezed
                    into just one.
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        For more information, google it, or <code>$ man cat</code> or
        <code>$ info coreutils 'cat invocation'</code>
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h3><code>wc</code></h3>
    <div id='wc'>
        <code>wc</code>, or <code>word count</code>, is used to count the
        number of characters (letters), words, and lines.<br /><br />

        By default, <code>wc</code> will give you all three counts:
        <?prettify lang=bash?>
        <pre class='prettyprint'>$ wc index.html
71  349 3115 index.html</pre>

        This tells us that the file index.html has 71 lines, 349 words, and
        3115 characters. To get only one of those values, we do this:
        <div class='table-responsive'>
            <table class='table table-bordered table-striped'>
                <tr>
                    <td>Command</td>
                    <td>Output</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <?prettify lang=bash?>
                        <pre class='prettyprint'>$ wc -c index.html
$ wc --chars index.html</pre>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        3115 index.html
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <?prettify lang=bash?>
                        <pre class='prettyprint'>$ wc -w index.html
$ wc --words index.html</pre>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        349 index.html
                    </td>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <?prettify lang=bash?>
                        <pre class='prettyprint'>$ wc -l index.html
$ wc --lines index.html</pre>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        71 index.html
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h3><code>tr</code></h3>
    <div id='tr'>
        <code>tr</code> is short for <code>transliterate</code>. <code>tr</code>
        is used to map a set of characters to another set of characters,
        according to the following pattern:<br /><br />

        <?prettify lang=bash?>
        <pre class='prettyprint'>$ tr 'source' 'dest'</pre>

        tr acts on stdin, and works like this:

        <?prettify lang=bash?>
        <pre class='prettyprint'>$ tr 'abc' 'xyz' &lt; myText</pre>

        If myText contains "a cat cannot bat", tr would trasform the text
        to "x zxt zxnnot yxt".<br /><br />

        tr also has some shorthands so that you don't have to type common
        patterns unnecessarily. For example, 'a-z' is automatically expanded
        to 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.<br /><br />

        tr can also be used to strip characters out of a string; the
        <code>-d</code> option will delete any character provided. For example:
        <?prettify lang=bash?>
        <pre class='prettyprint'>$ tr -d 'eht'
this is a test
is is a s</pre>
    </div>

<section>
    <h3><code>heads or tails?</code></h3>
    <div id='head-or-tail'>
        Often in computer science we call the front of something the
        <span class='keyword'>head</span> and we call the end the
        <span class='keyword'>tail</span>. Sometimes, we want to peek at a file
        but we don't care about the entire file; we just want to see the first
        few lines to see what the file contains, or the format that information
        is stored in. There are two incredibly useful tools to do this: head
        and tail. As their names suggest, head is used to view the beginning of
        a file, while tail is used to view the end of a file.<br /><br />

        By default, only 10 lines are shown. This number can be adjusted using
        <code>head -number</code>, for example:
        <?prettify lang=bash?>
        <pre class='prettyprint'>$ tail -30 myFile</pre>

        A useful pattern to have in your arsenal is combining head and tail to
        grab a certain section from a file. <code>head -30 | tail -10</code>
        will print out lines 21-30.
    </div>

<section>
    <h3><code>grep</code></h3>
    <div id='grep'>
        <code>grep</code> is an acronym for Globally search with Regular
        Expressions and Print. grep is used to search for lines in a file that
        match the provided pattern. The pattern is interpreted as a
        <span class='keyword'>regular expression</span>, which is covered in the
        next paragraph. grep takes a number of useful arguments:

        <table class='table table-bordered table-striped'>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    -i<br />
                    ignore
                </td>
                <td>
                    Ignore differences in upper-/lower-case for matching
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    -v<br />
                    invert
                </td>
                <td>
                    Display lines that <em>don't</em> match the pattern. This
                    is sometimes easier than finding a pattern for what you
                    actually want to match.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    -r<br />
                    recursive
                </td>
                <td>
                    Searches through all subdirectories as well as the current
                    directory.
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        grep is only one of a group of pattern-matching filters. One very useful
        filter to know is <code>egrep</code> or extended grep, which implements
        regexp fully (whereas grep does not implement <code>+</code>, <code>?</code>,
        <code>|</code> or <code>()</code>).

    <h3>Regular Expressions</h3>
    <div id='regular expressions'>
        <div id='regex-joke' class='joke pull-right'>
            You have a problem. You think "oh I know, I'll solve this with
            regular expressions!" You now have two problems.
        </div>
        Regular expressions are patterns used to match strings. There are a
        number of <em>special characters</em> which, used correctly, can make
        your regular expressions very powerful.<br /><br />
        Some special characters are <code>*</code>, <code>.</code> and
        <code>$</code>. To match the actual character instead of using their
        special meaning, you must <span class='keyword'>escape</span> them:
        <code>\*</code> matches the <code>*</code> character.<br /><br />

        Repeated patterns are denoted by <code>*</code>: <code>a*</code>
        means "0 or more 'a's". Parentheses (round brackets) denote groups:
        <code>(word)*</code> represents "0 or more repetitions of 'word'".
        <br /><br />

        Multiple patterns to match are separated by <code>|</code>;
        <code>ace|one|two</code> match any one of the strings <code>ace</code>,
        <code>one</code>, or <code>two</code>.<br /><br />

        <div class='alert alert-success'>
            It is technically possible to match any pattern with just a
            combination of <code>()*|</code>, but regular expressions
            have many more features that help to simplify your pattern.
        </div>

        <code>.</code> matches any character, only once.<br /><br />

        We can use square brackets to denote sets: <code>[aeiou]</code>
        matches any vowel, only once. Just like <code>tr</code>, there exist
        a number of shorthands for ranges of characters in regex. Some examples
        are <code>[a-f]</code> (a, b, c, d, e, f), <code>[a-z]</code>,
        <code>[0-9]</code>, <code>[a-zA-Z0-9]</code>. To invert the match of a
        set, we use <code>[^.....]</code>. For example, <code>[^aeiou]</code>
        matches any non-vowels. It is important to note that, with the
        exceptions of <code>[]\-^</code>, characters are stripped of their
        special meanings when inside square brackets.<br /><br />

        regex also allows us to specify that a pattern must be at the beginning
        or end of a line. <code>^</code> denotes the start of a line, and
        <code>$</code> denotes the end of a line. Note that <code>^</code>
        has different meanings when inside or outside <code>[]</code>.
        <code>^[the]</code> matches <code>t</code>, <code>h</code>, or
        <code>e</code> at the beginning of a line, but <code>[^the]</code>
        matches any single character that isn't <code>t</code>, <code>h</code>,
        or <code>e</code>. <code>a(b)*$</code> matches a followed by 0 or more
        'b's at the end of a line.<br /><br />

        We have already seen that <code>*</code> matches 0 or more repetitions,
        but sometimes we want something more specific. <code>+</code> matches 1
        or more repetitions, and <code>?</code> matches 0 or 1 repetitions. If
        a regular expression matches a line more than once, the first match in
        the line is chosen.
    </div>

<section>
    <h3><code>cut</code></h3>

    <div id='cut'>
        <code>cut</code> is used to cut out certain parts of the input. With
        columnated input, cut can be used to extract certain fields. Otherwise,
        cut can extract the characters in certain positions (for example,
        characters 2-5).<br /><br />

        The <code>-d</code> flag is used to specify the
        <span class='keyword'>column deliminator</span>.<br />
        The <code>-f</code> flag is used to specify which fields to extract.
        <code>-f</code> uses tabs as the column deliminator unless
        otherwise specified by <code>-d</code>.<br />
        The <code>-c</code> flag specifies the characters to extract.
        Characters are expressed either as a range (<code>2-5</code>) or
        comma-separated (<code>1, 3, 5</code>).
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h3><code>paste</code></h3>

    <div id='paste'>
        <code>paste</code> is the opposite of cut: input files are displayed
        next to each other. The first line of output is made up of the first
        lines of each input file, the second line is made up of the second
        lines of each file, etc. Thus if we dissect a file with cut, we can
        put it back together with paste.
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h3><code>sort</code></h3>

    <div id='sort'>
        <code>sort</code> orders input in a particular way. The default
        behaviour of the filter is to sort
        <span class='keyword'>lexicographically</span>, but you can also sort
        by number value.<br /><br />

        sort takes a number of useful flags.

        <table class='table table-bordered table-striped'>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <code>-r</code><br />
                    <code>--reverse</code>
                </td>
                <td>
                    Sort in reverse order
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <code>-n</code><br />
                    <code>--numeric-sort</code>
                </td>
                <td>
                    Sort by number value rather than lexicographically
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <code>-d</code><br />
                    <code>--dictionary-order</code>
                </td>
                <td>
                    Sort in dictionary order; ignore non-letters and non-digits
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <code>-t</code><br />
                    <code>--field-separator</code>
                </td>
                <td>
                    Specify a column deliminator, <code>-t'|'</code> marks | as
                    the deliminator. The single quotes are not strictly necessary,
                    but as we now know, single quotes will prevent characters from
                    being misinterpreted by the shell.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <code>-k</code>
                </td>
                <td>
                    Specifies the column to sort on: <code>-k3</code> sorts on
                    the third column.
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h3><code>uniq</code></h3>

    <div id='uniq'>
        <code>uniq</code> squashes repeated lines into a single line. As this
        is a rare situation, uniq is usually combined with sort.<br /><br />

        <code>uniq -c</code> prints the number of times that a line is
        repeated, after squashing.<br /><br />

        <code>uniq -d</code> prints only duplicated lines (once each)<br /><br />

        The opposite of <code>-d</code> is <code>-u</code>, which prints unique
        lines only.
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h3><code>sed</code></h3>

    <div id='sed'>
        <code>sed</code> is the <code>stream editor</code>. A useful command
        is s<br /><br />
        <code>$ sed 's/int/char/'</code> replaces the first instance of "int"
        with "char". <code>$ sed 's/int/char/g'</code> replaces all instances
        of "int" with "char".
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>pipelines</h3>

    <div id='pipelines'>
        The pipe (<code>|</code>) is used to redirect information. In the
        command <code>cat myFile | tr 'abc' 'def'</code>, the contents of
        myFile are redirected to the input of the tr command. Thus, the tr
        command is executed on the contents of myFile, and then printed to
        stdout.<br /><br />

        Pipelines can become very complicated, but very powerful. An example
        taken straight from COMP2041 is
        <code>cut -d'|' -f2 enrolments | sort | uniq | wc -l</code> which,
        in that particular example, is being used to count the number of
        "distinct individuals" enrolled in different courses. The second
        column (delimited by a pipe) is extracted, then sorted, then
        repetitions are squashed, and the number of lines (the number of
        students) is calculated.
    </div>
