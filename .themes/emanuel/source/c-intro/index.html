    <h3>The Anatomy of a C Program</h3>
    <div id='program-outline'>
        When programming in C, every program you write will have the same outline:

        <div class='prettyheader'>
            Example 1
        </div>
        <?prettify lang=c?>
        <pre class='prettyprint'>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int main (int argc, char* argv[]) {

    // YOUR CODE GOES HERE

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</pre><br />

        <div class='alert alert-success'>
            <b>Note</b>: You can write comments in your program that are ignored when you run it.
            For one line comments, this is done with a <code>//</code> as above. For multi-line
            comments, we format the comment<br /><br />

            <code>/* Your multi-line<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;comment goes<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here */</code>

    <h3>Style Guide</h3>
    <div id='style-guide'>
        <span class='keyword'>Style</span> is paramount in writing a readable, understandable program.
        Group projects and code collaboration are both big parts of professional programming, so
        well-formatted code is expected and appreciated.<br /><br />

        We will teach you C in a clean, readable style, and your personal flair will show up with
        practice. As long as your code remains nicely formatted, deviations from the
        <span class='keyword'>styleguide</span> are acceptable.<br /><br />

        Structurally speaking, style when programming in C can be the difference between
        your code working or not working. We will learn more about this in a later module, though
        you can take a look at the <a href="https://wiki.cse.unsw.edu.au/info/CoreCourses/StyleGuide">
        UNSW's C Style Guide</a> if you are interested.

    <h3>Your first C program</h3>
    <div id='hello-world'>
        When learning a new programming language, the first thing we do is write a program to display
        the message "Hello world" on the screen. This will give us an understanding of the basic syntax
        and structural layout of a program.<br /><br />

        Don't worry if it doesn't make sense yet - this is what we are here to learn.

        <div class='prettyheader'>
            Example 2: helloWorld.c
        </div>
        <?prettify lang=c?>
        <pre class='prettyprint linenums'>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int main (int argc, char* argv[]) {

    printf("Hello world!");

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</pre>

        A lot of this looks strange. Don't worry about it for now - all you
        have to notice is this:<br /> When we print something out to the
        screen, we use <code>printf</code>, a
        <span class='keyword'>function</span> which takes a string and prints
        it out to <code>stdout</code>.<br /><br />

        At the moment, our program is in a language that we can easily
        understand. However, the C file alone is not something that the
        computer can understand. To convert a file to
        <span class='keyword'>machine language</span>, the C file must go
        through a process called <span class='keyword'>compilation</span>.
        <br /><br />

        The tool we use for compilation is called
        <span class='keyword'>GCC</span>. We like to have lots of control over
        the compilation process, so we do the compilation ourselves from the
        terminal. First, <code>cd</code> to the directory where you've saved
        the file. In this example, let's say that the C file with our C code in
        it is called <code>helloWorld.c</code>. To
        <span class='keyword'>compile</span> our code, we run:
        <?prettify lang=bash?>
        <pre class='prettyprint'>$ gcc -Wall -Werror helloWorld.c -o hello</pre>

        Let's break that command down.<br /><br />
        
        We can see that we're asking GCC to do..
        something. We're passing two flags: <code>-Wall</code> and
        <code>-Werror</code>. Usually when we compile we get some warnings
        about our code, but our program <em>should</em> still run without any
        problems. However, the warnings indicate that there's something not
        quite right about what we're telling the computer to do. Hence, we want
        to avoid warnings. <code>-Wall</code> tells gcc to show all warnings
        that are found. <code>-Werror</code> tells gcc to treat all warnings as
        errors, so that our code won't successfully compile if there are any
        warnings.<br /><br />

        After those two flags, we then need to tell the compiler which file we
        want to compile (<code>helloWorld.c</code>), and finally, the file that
        we want to output the <span class='keyword'>executable</span> code to
        (<code>hello</code>). Note that the output file must come directly
        after <code>-o</code>. If you try to do something like

        <?prettify lang=bash?>
        <pre class='prettyprint'>$ gcc -Wall -Werror hello -o helloWorld.c</pre>

        instead, your helloWorld.c file will be overwritten and you'll lose all
        of the work that you've done. However, something like

        <?prettify lang=bash?>
        <pre class='prettyprint'>$ gcc -o hello -Werror helloWorld.c -Wall</pre>

        is fine.

    <h3>Variables</h3>
    <div id='variables'>
        When programming, we use <span class='keyword'>variables</span> to store information
        which we use in our program. They are called variables as their values can be changed.
        In C (unlike some other languages) the <span class='keyword'>type</span> of a variable
        cannot be changed. We must choose the correct type of variable to represent the data
        we want to store in it.<br /><br />

        Here are some basic types, commonly used in C programs. There are other types, but
        we tend to prefer the following to their alternatives.<br /><br />
        <table class='table table-bordered table-striped'>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <code>int</code>
                </td>
                <td>
                    Integer
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <code>char</code>
                </td>
                <td>
                    Character
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <code>double</code>
                </td>
                <td>
                    Double-precision floating point number
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Placeholders</h3>
    <div id='placeholders'>
        We can print out the value of a variable with <code>printf</code> like we used in
        the "Hello world" example. To do this, we must <span class='keyword'>format</span>
        a <span class='keyword'>string</span>. This means we must reserve a place in the
        string for the variables. This reservation is called a
        <span class='keyword'>placeholder</span>.<br /><br />

        Every type of variable has its own placeholder:<br /><br />

        <table class='table table-bordered table-striped'>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Type</th>
                    <th>Placeholder</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <code>int</code>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <code>%d</code>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <code>char</code>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <code>%c</code>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <code>double</code>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <code>%lf</code>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <div class='prettyheader'>
            Example 3
        </div>
        <?prettify lang=c?>
        <pre class='prettyprint linenums'>

    int myNumber = 5;
