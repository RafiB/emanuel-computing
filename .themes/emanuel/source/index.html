        <h2>Welcome to Emanuel Computing!</h2>
        <p>
            This course is designed for students who want to learn how to code. It may
            be a bit slow for those who have programming experience, but will cover
            some important topics.

        <h2>The Rules</h2>
        <p>
            Muck around you're out. That goes for behaviour, bullying, or running <code>rm -rf *</code><br /><br />

            I don't care if you're late, I don't care if you skip a week, but don't be disruptive<br /><br />

            This is not high school, I expect a different level of engagement and maturity<br /><br />

            Help another student and get yourself a reward<br /><br />

            There are tasks to do. They aren't homework, but you'll be a lot better off if you do the questions, and I'll know if you haven't done them. If you aren't here to improve, why are you here? BUT if you try and don't succeed, you're doing awesomely! Drop me an email (I'll reply between 1000 and 0100) and I'll see what I can do to help.
