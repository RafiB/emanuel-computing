                This course is aimed at students who have a keen interest in the practical
                application of programming. It may be a bit slow for those who have
                programming experience, but will cover some important topics.

            <h2>The Rules</h2>
            <p>
                Put in the effort and you'll be amazed by how quickly you'll develop new skills.<br /><br />

                This is not high school, this is a once-a-week opportunity to leave school behind and learn university-level
                content in a university-style arena. As such, the course will not be policed - no one is going to chase you
                to complete a task, reprimand you if you arrive late, or even don't show up.<br /><br />

                However, don't be disruptive when you're here. There is no tolerance for bad or inappropriate behaviour.<br /><br />

                Tasks will be set. They are not mandatory, but have a go! Remember the golden rule in computing: <em>if you
                don't know how to do something, google it</em>. If you try (even if you don't succeed), know you're doing awesomely!
                <br /><br />

                Help another student and you get a small reward. Complete all homework problems for 4 weeks in a row and earn
                a prize (USB stick, earphones, ..)<br /><br />

                Any problems or queries, drop me an email and I'll see what I can do to help.<br /><br />

                Above all, remember to have fun!
