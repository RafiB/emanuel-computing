# We're using Octopress
It's awesome.

[Check it out](http://octopress.org)

Just read their [docs](http://octopress.org/docs/). They tell you enough.
I've ripped out a lot of the guts of their blogging site to turn this
into a simple content serving site. You should be able to follow what's
going on. If not, drop me an email at rafiblecher@gmail.com

## Setup

You'll need to follow http://octopress.org/docs/setup/

**Note**: don't run `rake install`, run `rake install[emanuel]`
