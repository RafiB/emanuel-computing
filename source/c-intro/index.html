    <div id='program-outline'>
        When programming in C, every program you write will have the same outline:

        <?prettify lang=c?>
        <pre class='prettyprint'>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int main (int argc, char* argv[]) {

    // YOUR CODE GOES HERE

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</pre><br />

        <div class='alert alert-success'>
            <b>Note</b>: You can write comments in your program that are ignored when you run it.
            For one line comments, this is done with a <code>//</code> as above. For multi-line
            comments, we format the comment<br /><br />

            <code>/* Your multi-line<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;comment goes<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here */</code>

    <h3 class='expandable'>Style Guide</h3>
    <div id='style-guide'>
        <span class='keyword'>Style</span> is paramount in writing a readable, understandable program.
        Group projects and code collaboration are both big parts of professional programming, so
        well-formatted code is expected and appreciated.<br /><br />

        We will teach you C in a clean, readable style, and your personal flair will show up with
        practice. As long as your code remains nicely formatted, deviations from the
        <span class='keyword'>styleguide</span> are acceptable.<br /><br />

        Structurally speaking, style when programming in C can be the difference between
        your code working or not working. We will learn more about this in a later module, though
        you can take a look at the <a href="https://wiki.cse.unsw.edu.au/info/CoreCourses/StyleGuide">
        UNSW's C Style Guide</a> if you are interested.

    <h3 class='expandable'>Your first C program</h3>
    <div id='hello-world'>
        When learning a new programming language, the first thing we do is write a program to display
        the message "Hello world" on the screen. This will give us an understanding of the basic syntax
        and structural layout of a program.<br />

        <?prettify lang=c?>
        <pre class='prettyprint linenums'>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int main (int argc, char* argv[]) {

    printf("Hello world!");

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</pre>

        Don't worry if it doesn't make sense yet - this is what we are here to learn.
        All you have to notice is this:<br /> When we print something out to the
        screen, we use <code>printf</code>, a
        <span class='keyword'>function</span> which takes a string and prints
        it out to <code>stdout</code>.<br /><br />

        At the moment, our program is in a language that we can easily
        understand. However, the C file alone is not something that the
        computer can understand. To convert a file to
        <span class='keyword'>machine language</span>, the C file must go
        through a process called <span class='keyword'>compilation</span>.
        <br /><br />

        The tool we use for compilation is called
        <span class='keyword'>GCC</span>. We like to have lots of control over
        the compilation process, so we do the compilation ourselves from the
        terminal. First, <code>cd</code> to the directory where you've saved
        the file. In this example, let's say that the C file with our C code in
        it is called <code>helloWorld.c</code>. To
        <span class='keyword'>compile</span> our code, we run:
        <?prettify lang=bash?>
        <pre class='prettyprint'>$ gcc -Wall -Werror helloWorld.c -o hello</pre>

        Let's break that command into its components.<br /><br />

        When compiling code there are two issues which we can be faced with:
        warnings and errors. Warnings tell us that something is not quite right
        with the code. GCC will compile the code despite warnings. Errors are
        bigger problems. They occur when GCC can't understand your code.<br /><br />

        The two flags being used here are <code>-Wall</code> and
        <code>-Werror</code>. The -Wall flag enables GCC's common warning flags.
        The -Werror flag treats all warnings as errors. This means that we have
        a lot more information about our code when debugging.<br /><br />

        After these two flags, we then need to tell the compiler which file we
        want to compile. In this case it is <code>helloWorld.c</code>.<br /><br />

        The <code>-o</code> flag tells GCC to output, and following this we
        specify the name of the file that we want to output the
        <span class='keyword'>executable</span> code to. Here we call it
        <code>hello</code>. While the -Wall and -Werror flags can be split up,
        the output file name must come directly after <code>-o</code>. For
        example, something like

        <?prettify lang=bash?>
        <pre class='prettyprint'>$ gcc -Wall -Werror hello -o helloWorld.c</pre>

        will overwrite your helloWorld.c file with the output. However,

        <?prettify lang=bash?>
        <pre class='prettyprint'>$ gcc -o hello -Werror helloWorld.c -Wall</pre>

        will work as we want.

    <h3 class='expandable'>Variables</h3>
    <div id='variables'>
        When programming, we use <span class='keyword'>variables</span> to store information
        which we use in our program. They are called variables as their values can be changed.
        In C (unlike some other languages) the <span class='keyword'>type</span> of a variable
        cannot be changed. We must choose the correct type of variable to represent the data
        we want to store in it.<br /><br />

        Here are some basic types, commonly used in C programs. There are other types, but
        we tend to prefer the following to their alternatives.<br /><br />
        <table class='table table-bordered table-striped'>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <code>int</code>
                </td>
                <td>
                    Integer
                </td>

                <td>

                <td>
                    Double-precision floating point number (decimal)
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h3 class='expandable'>Placeholders</h3>
    <div id='placeholders'>
        We can print out the value of a variable with <code>printf</code> like we used in
        the "Hello world" example. To do this, we must <span class='keyword'>format</span>
        a <span class='keyword'>string</span>. This means we must reserve a place in the
        string for the variables. This reservation is called a
        <span class='keyword'>placeholder</span>.<br /><br />

        Every type of variable has its own placeholder:<br /><br />

        <table class='table table-bordered table-striped'>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Type</th>
                    <th>Placeholder</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <code>int</code>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <code>%d</code>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <code>char</code>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <code>%c</code>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <code>double</code>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <code>%lf</code>

                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        Here, a placeholder will be used to hold a place for our variable in the string which we
        are printing.

        C runs code line by line from the top of the file. Think about it as a human

                        so the code inside the braces will run.

                met, then the loop will not run. An example of a while loop is:
