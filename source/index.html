                This course is designed for students who want to learn how to code. It may
                be a bit slow for those who have programming experience, but will cover
                some important topics.

            <h2>The Rules</h2>
            <p>
                Muck around you're out. That goes for behaviour, bullying, or running <code>rm -rf *</code><br /><br />

                This is not high school, I expect a different level of engagement and maturity.
                This is a once-a-week opportunity to leave school behind and learn university-level
                content in a university-style arena.<br /><br />

                You can be late, you can skip weeks, but don't be disruptive when you're here<br /><br />

                There are tasks to do. They aren't homework, but you'll be a lot better off
                if you do the questions, and I'll know if you haven't done them. If you
                aren't here to improve, why are you here? BUT if you try and don't succeed,
                you're doing awesomely! Drop me an email (I'll reply some time after 1000)
                and I'll see what I can do to help.<br /><br />

                Help another student and get yourself a lolly. Complete all homework problems for 4 weeks and earn a prize (USB stick, earphones, ..)<br /><br />

                If you don't know how to do something, google it!
