    <h2>The Linux Terminal</h2>
</div>

<section>
    <h3>Foreword</h3>
    <div id='foreword'>
        <span class='keyword'>Linux</span> is a computer operating system. Linux
        is a variant of <span class='keyword'>Unix</span>. Indeed, Linux is named
        after the original developer of Linux; Linus Torvalds.<br />
        Mac OS-X, the operating system that your apple laptops are running, is
        Unix-based. Thus, whenever "Linux" is mentioned, we are really talking
        about Unix variants. All instructions covered here will work on Mac
        laptops.<br /><br />

        Unix systems are organised in a hierarchy, or in computer science terms, a
        <span class='keyword'>tree</span>. The <span class='keyword'>root</span>
        of the tree, or the highest point in the hierarchy, is called the
        <span class='keyword'>root directory</span> and is represented simply by
        <code>/</code>.<br /><br />

        Folders in the root directory take the form
        <code>/&lt;folder-name&gt;</code>, such as <code>/home</code><br /><br />

        Sub-folders are named in the same fashion. My "home directory", the folder
        assigned to my user, is <code>/home/rafi</code><br /><br />

        And now, it is time to start learning how to navigate around the
        hierarchy!<br /><br />

        To do this, we use the <span class='keyword'>terminal</span>, or
        <span class='keyword'>console</span>.<br /><br />

        <div class='alert alert-success'>
            Note: in examples concerning the terminal, <code>$</code>
            represents the <span class='keyword'>prompt</span>, which is the
            part of the terminal that waits for the next instruction.
        </div>

        <h1>can someone please talk about single vs double quotes. Rafi doesn't want to type things</h1>

    <h3><code>pwd</code></h3>
    <div id='pwd'>
        <code>pwd</code> stands for <code>print working directory</code>. The
        <code>working</code> directory is the directory that you are currently in.
        <br /><br />
        This is a very handy tool to have when you're using files that are spread
        across different folders on your computer.

            <h4 class='expandable'><b>Examples</b></h4>
            <div id='pwd-examples'>
                <?prettify lang=bash?>
                <pre class='prettyprint'>$ pwd
/home/rafi</pre>
            </div>
        </section>

                <pre class='prettyprint'>$ pwd

        </section>
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h3><code>cd</code></h3>
    <div id='cd'>
        <code>cd</code> stands for <code>change directory</code>. This command is
        used, as its name might suggest, to move between directories. For
        example, if you are in your home directory (<code>/home/username</code>)
        and you want to change to the root directory (<code>/</code>), you would
        enter the command <code>cd /</code> into the terminal.
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h3><code>ls</code></h3>
    <div id='ls'>
        <code>ls</code> is the <code>list</code> command. It is used to list the
        files and sub-directories contained in a directory.<br /><br />

        Simply entering <code>ls</code> in the terminal will list the files in the
        current directory. You can provide options (called
        <span class='keyword'>arguments</span>) to <code>ls</code>. For example,
        <code>$ ls /</code> will list the contents of the root directory.
        <?prettify lang=bash?>
        <pre class='prettyprint'>$ ls /
bin  boot  cdrom  dev  etc  home  initrd.img  initrd.img.old  lib  lib32  lib64  lost+found  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var  vmlinuz</pre>


        Most of these tools also have <span class='keyword'>flags</span>, which are
        short arguments that slightly modify the way a tool works. Some useful flags
        for <code>ls</code> are:<br /><br />

        <code>$ ls -a</code>: list <em>all</em> files, including hidden files and
        directories (which begin with a <code>.</code>).<br /><br />

        <code>$ ls -l</code>: list with <span class='keyword'>long listing</span>
        format.<br /><br />

        You can combine these flags. To list all files in long listing format,
        you use <code>$ ls -la</code> or <code>$ ls -al</code>.<br /><br />

        You can find more flags by reading the manual page for <code>ls</code>
        (type <code>man ls</code>) into the terminal.
    </div>

    <h3><code>cp</code></h3>
    <div id='cp'>
        <code>cp</code> is the <code>copy</code> command. <code>cp</code> is
        used to copy files and directories around the filesystem.<br /><br />

        For example, to create a copy of a file as a backup, you could run
        <code>cp helloWorld.c helloWorld.c.bkp</code><br /><br />

        You can also copy entire directories, but doing so requires you to
        <span class='keyword'>recursively</span> copy the folder's contents.
        This means copying the folder, and any files or folders inside that
        folder, and any folders inside those folders, ...<br />
        The command to do that would be <code>$ cp -r existing-folder new-folder</code>
        which uses the <code>-r</code> flag to mean <code>recursive</code><br /><br />

        You must be very careful with the <code>cp</code> tool, as you can
        unintentionally overwrite files. It is for this reason that we recommend
        you always back up important files before venturing into unfamiliar
        tech territory.
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h3><code>mv</code></h3>
    <div id='mv'>
        Similar to the <code>cp</code> tool is <code>mv</code>, or <code>move</code>.
        <code>mv</code> is a very powerful tool, but this is not always a good thing.
        <br /><br />

        You can use <code>mv</code> to rename files or folders, by moving them to
        a new location. For example:<br />
        <code>$ mv old-file new-file</code><br /><br />

        However, if there already exists a file or folder named "new-file", it
        will be replaced by the new file, and you will lose the old file or folder.
        Always be careful with your <code>mv</code> instructions.<br /><br />

        Think of <code>mv</code> as a "cut and paste" command, where <code>cp</code>
        is "copy and paste".
</section>

<section>
    <h3><code>rm</code></h3>
    <div id='rm'>
        A truly terrifying tool, <code>rm</code> is the <code>remove</code> command.
        It is used to delete files or folders.<br /><br />

        You can use <code>rm</code> to delete one or more files at a time:<br />
        <?prettify lang=bash?>
        <pre class='prettyprint'>$ rm myFile
$ rm myFile1 myFile2 myFile3</pre>

        You can even delete entire folders in one command, using the <code>-r</code>
        flag (recursive):<br />
        <code>$ rm -r myFolder</code><br /><br />

        You can also try to force the deletion of a file (you can't always delete
        a file or directory that doesn't belong to your user). To do this, you use
        the <code>-f</code> flag.<br /><br />

        <div class='alert alert-danger'>
            Warning: the following command deletes as many files on your
            computer as possible. If you run it on your computer or someone
            else's computer, you will be kicked out of this course. No second
            chances.
        </div>

        You can combine the <code>-r</code> and <code>-f</code> flags to
        <em>forcefullly, recursively delete</em> every file in a directory.<br />
        Running <code>$ rm -rf /*</code> will attempt to delete every file in
        the filesystem, including any mounted storage systems (USB sticks,
        external hard drives, etc.)<br /><br />

        This command is being taught to you only so you know to <em>avoid</em> it.
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h3><code>mkdir</code></h3>
    <div id='mkdir'>
        The <code>mkdir</code> command stands for <code>make directory</code>.
        It is used to create a new directory in the filesystem.<br /><br />

        <code>$ mkdir newFolder</code> will create a directory called newFolder
        inside the current directory. Like other commands, you can specify a
        location for <code>mkdir</code> to be run, e.g.
        <code>$ mkdir /home/rafi/newFolder</code>.<br /><br />

        An immensely useful flag for <code>mkdir</code> is <code>-p</code>,
        which produces no error if a folder already exists:
        <?prettify lang=bash?>
        <pre class='prettyprint'>$ mkdir /home/rafi
mkdir: cannot create directory ‘/home/rafi’: File exists
$ mkdir -p /home/rafi
$</pre>

        <code>-p</code> also creates the parents of a directory if they do
        not already exist. For example, you could do:<br />
        <code>$ mkdir -p /home/rafi/newFolder/newChild</code><br />
        instead of<br />
        <code>$ mkdir /home/rafi/newFolder &amp;&amp; mkdir /home/rafi/newFolder/newChild</code><br />
        <span class='small'>Here we see a new tool: <code>&amp;&amp;</code>. This is
        <span class='keyword'>and</span>, and can chain multiple commands
        together to run one after the other.</span>
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h3><code>rmdir</code></h3>
    <div id='rmdir'>
        As might be obvious by now, the <code>rmdir</code> command stands for
        <code>remove directory</code>. A relatively weak tool, <code>rmdir</code>
        can only be used to delete completely empty directories. As discussed
        before, to delete a non-empty directory we must recursively delete it,
        using <code>rm -r</code>.<br /><br />

        Example usage:<br />
        <code>$ rmdir aFolder</code>
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Special Folders</h3>
    <div id='special-folders'>
        There are two special folders contained in every folder. These are
        <code>.</code> and <code>..</code>.<br /><br />

        <code>.</code> is the current directory. It is very useful when
        running programs, as you can run <code>./executable</code> instead
        of, for example, <code>/home/rafi/c-programs/helloWorld</code>.
        <br /><br />

        <code>..</code> is the parent directory. <code>..</code> comes in
        handy when you need to quickly reference a directory that is above
        the working directory:<br />
        <code>$ cd ..</code> will change up to the parent of the working directory<br />
        <code>$ ../anotherFolder/executable</code> will run the executable
        file called <code>executable</code> in the folder called "anotherFolder",
        contained in the working directory's parent.
    </div>

<section>
    <h3><code>chmod</code></h3>
    <div id='chmod'>
        Every file and folder in linux has its own set of permissions:
        permissions for the owner of the file, for the group that the
        file belongs to, and permissions for everyone else.<br /><br />

        There are nine permissions on every file: <b>r</b>ead,
        <b>w</b>rite (change) and e<b>x</b>ecute (run) for the owner of the file,
        for the group of the file, and for others who are neither the owner
        nor in the group.<br /><br />

        For example, a file with modes <code>rwxr-xr--</code> has the following
        permissions:
        <table class='table table-bordered text-center'>
            <tr>
                <td></td>
                <td>read</td>
                <td>write</td>
                <td>execute</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>user</td>
                <td><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span></td>
                <td><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span></td>
                <td><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>group</td>
                <td><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span></td>
                <td></td>
                <td><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>others</td>
                <td><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span></td>
                <td></td>
                <td></td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        These permissions (called <span class='keyword'>modes</span>) are
        modified with the <code>chmod</code> command (<code>change mode</code>).
        <br /><br />

        In the example above, running <code>chmod g+w</code> will add
        <b>w</b>rite permissions for the file's group, while
        <code>chmod o-r</code> will remove <b>r</b>ead permissions for
        <b>o</b>thers.<br />
        This would leave us with a permission set <code>rwxrwx---</code>, or
        <table class='table table-bordered text-center'>
            <tr>
                <td></td>
                <td>read</td>
                <td>write</td>
                <td>execute</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>user</td>
                <td><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span></td>
                <td><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span></td>
                <td><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>group</td>
                <td><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span></td>
                <td><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span></td>
                <td><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>others</td>
                <td></td>
                <td></td>
                <td></td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h3><code>chown</code></h3>
    <div id='chown'>
        To change the owner and group of a file, we use the tool
        <code>chown</code>.<br /><br />

        For example, to change the ower of a file to rafi and the group of the
        file to plugdev, we would run:<br />
        <code>$ chown rafi:plugdev filename</code><br /><br />

        To apply the new owner/group to an entire directory, we use the
        <code>-R</code> (not <code>-r</code>) flag:<br />
        <code>$ chown -R rafi:plugdev foldername</code>
    </div>
</section>
