    <h3>Foreword</h3>
    <p id='foreword'>
        <span class='keyword'>Linux</span> is a computer operating system. Linux
        is a variant of <span class='keyword'>Unix</span>. Indeed, Linux is named
        after the original developer of Linux; Linus Torvalds.<br />
        Mac OS-X, the operating system that your apple laptops are running, is
        Unix-based. Thus, whenever "Linux" is mentioned, we are really talking
        about Unix variants. All instructions covered here will work on Mac
        laptops.<br /><br />

        The linux terminal is a hierarchy, or in computer science terms, a
        <span class='keyword'>tree</span>. The <span class='keyword'>root</span>
        of the tree, or the highest point in the hierarchy, is called the
        <span class='keyword'>root directory</span> and is represented simply by
        <code>/</code>.<br /><br />

        Folders in the root directory take the form
        <code>/&lt;folder-name&gt;</code>, such as <code>/home</code><br /><br />

        Sub-folders are named in the same fashion. My "home directory", the folder
        assigned to my user, is <code>/home/rafi</code><br /><br />

        And now, it is time to start learning how to navigate around the
        hierarchy!<br /><br />

        To do this, we use the <span class='keyword'>terminal</span>, or
        <span class='keyword'>console</span>.<br /><br />

        <small>Note: in examples concerning the terminal, <code>$</code> represents
        the <span class='keyword'>prompt</span>, which is the part of the terminal
        that waits for the next instruction.</small>

    <h3><code>pwd</code></h3>
    <p id='pwd'>
        <code>pwd</code> stands for <code>print working directory</code>. The
        <code>working</code> directory is the directory that you are currently in.
        <br /><br />
        This is a very handy tool to have when you're using files that are spread
        across different folders on your computer.

    <h3><code>cd</code></h3>
    <p id='cd'>
        <code>cd</code> stands for <code>change directory</code>. This command is
        used, as its name might suggest, to move between directories. For
        example, if you are in your home directory (<code>/home/username</code>)
        and you want to change to the root directory (<code>/</code>), you would
        enter the command <code>cd /</code> into the terminal.

    <h3><code>ls</code></h3>
    <p id='ls'>
        <code>ls</code> is the <code>list</code> command. It is used to list the
        files and sub-directories contained in a directory.<br /><br />

        Simply entering <code>ls</code> in the terminal will list the files in the
        current directory. You can provide options (called
        <span class='keyword'>arguments</span>) to <code>ls</code>. For example,
        <code>ls /</code> will list the contents of the root
        directory.<br /><br />

        Most of these tools also have <span class='keyword'>flags</span>, which are
        short arguments that slightly modify the way a tool works. Some useful flags
        for <code>ls</code> are:<br /><br />

        <code>ls -a</code> lists <em>all</em> files, including hidden files and
        directories (which begin with a <code>.</code>).<br /><br />

        <code>ls -l</code> lists with <span class='keyword'>long listing</span>
        format.<br /><br />

        You can combine these flags. To list all files in long listing format,
        you use <code>ls -la</code> or <code>ls -al</code>.<br /><br />

        You can find more flags by reading the manual page for <code>ls</code>
        (type <code>man ls</code>) into the terminal.

    <h3 class='para-heading'>Special Folders</h3>
    <p id='special-folders'>
        There are two special folders contained in every folder. These are
        <code>.</code> and <code>..</code>.
