    <h3>The leadup</h3>
    <div id='the-leadup'>
        Instead of using an editor with a <span class='keyword'>GUI</span>, we
        like to use a text editor that can run in the terminal. This is
        particularly important as it means we can use a text editor when we
        connect to another computer via <span class='keyword'>SSH</span>.
        <br /><br />

        I particularly like <span class='keyword'>vim</span>, but
        <span class='keyword'>emacs</span> is also popular. We'll briefly
        cover some ways of playing with text files in the terminal before
        covering the basics of vim.<br /><br />

    <h3>Echo and Redirection</h3>
    <div id='echo-and-redirection'>
        We use the <code>echo</code> tool to print things out in the
        terminal:<br />
        <?prettify lang=bash?>
        <pre class='prettyprint'>$ echo "Hello World"
Hello World</pre>

        We can also use <span class='keyword'>redirection</span> to direct
        where information goes in the terminal. By default, information is
        printed out to <code>stdout</code>, or <em>standard output</em>.
        To direct where that information goes we use the <code>&gt;</code>
        operator. Combining <code>echo</code> and redirection, we can
        direct the output of <code>echo</code> (printed out to stdout) to
        a file:<br />

        <?prettify lang=bash?>
        <pre class='prettyprint'>$ echo "Hello World" &gt; myFile</pre>

        The file <code>myFile</code> now contains the text
        <code>Hello World</code>. Be careful, as <code>&gt;</code> overwrites
        file contents. To add to the end of a file instead of replacing the
        contents of a file, we <span class='keyword'>append</span> to the
        file: running<br />

        <?prettify lang=bash?>
        <pre class='prettyprint'>$ echo "World Hello" &gt;&gt; myFile</pre>

        will result in <code>myFile</code> containing

        <pre class='prettyprint'>Hello World
World Hello</pre>
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>cat</h3>
    <div id='cat'>
        <code>cat</code> is the <code>concatenate</code> tool. It's used to
        print out the contents of files to stdout. Continuing from the above
        example:<br />
        <?prettify lang=bash?>
        <pre class='prettyprint'>$ echo "Hello World" &gt; myFile
$ echo "World Hello" &gt;&gt; myFile
$ cat myFile
Hello World
World Hello
$</pre>
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>less</h3>
    <div id='less'>
        <code>less</code> is a tool that we can use to read a file. We can
        use a few keyboard shortcuts to navigate around the file. A number
        followed by <code>g</code> will take you to that line number in the
        file. By itself, <code>g</code> takes you to the first line of the
        file and <code>G</code> takes you to the last line of the file.<br /><br />

        <code>/</code> allows you to search through a file, which becomes
        incredibly handy once you learn <span class='keyword'>regular expressions</span>,
        covered later in this course. <code>?</code> allows you to search
        through a file, searching backwards from the bottom. <code>n</code>
        takes you to the next match for your search in the file, and
        <code>N</code> takes you to the previous match.<br /><br />

        Pressing the space bar acts as Page Down, and <code>b</code> acts as
        Page Up. There are many more shortcuts, but these are the important
        ones. Finally, to exit <code>less</code>, use <code>q</code>.
    </div>

    <h3>nano</h3>
    <div id='nano'>
        <code>nano</code> is the first real text <em>editor</em> that we look
        at. <code>nano</code> is a baby text editor, with simple shortcuts and
        extremely basic functionality. Noteable amongst nano's shortcuts are
        <code>^O</code> (control-O) to save, and <code>^X</code> to exit.<br /><br />

        You will notice that you can't use a mouse to place the typing cursor:
        all movements have to be made with the keyboard arrows.<br /><br />

        nano is basically useless once you learn vim, so let's move on.

    <h3>vim</h3>
    <div id='vim'>
        vim is a <span class='keyword'>moded editor</span>. There are three
        equally important modes in vim: command mode, insert mode, and
        visual mode.<br /><br />

        Command mode is used to send instructions to vim. You can do things
        like saving files, changing the files you're editing, editing multiple
        files at once, searching, find+replace-ing, etc.<br /><br />

        Insert mode is used to type into a file. There isn't much that you can
        do with insert mode besides the different ways to start typing:<br />

        <table class='table table-bordered table-striped'>
            <tr>
                <td>i</td>
                <td>Start typing where the cursor is</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>a</td>
                <td>Start typing one character after where the cursor is</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>o</td>
                <td>Start typing on a new line underneath the cursor</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>O</td>
                <td>Start typing on a new line above the cursor</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        Visual mode is used to highlight text. Again, visual mode isn't too
        exciting, but it is very useful.

        <table class='table table-bordered table-striped'>
            <tr>
                <td>v</td>
                <td>Visual: move the cursor in visual mode to
                    highlight</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>shift+v</td>
                <td>Visual line: highlight line by line</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>^v</td>
                <td>Visual block: highlight a block of characters over
                    different lines</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        There are a number of other useful shortcuts that are worth knowing.
        From command mode:

        <table class='table table-bordered table-striped'>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    :w<br />
                    write
                </td>
                <td>
                    Save the file
                </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>:q<br />
                    quit
                </td>
                <td>
                    Exit from vim
                </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>:wq</td>
                <td>
                    Save the file and then exit from vim
                </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>
                    d<br />
                    delete
                </td>
                <td>
                    vim's delete functionality is actually very useful:
                    delete acts as cut. Hence, deleting text puts it in your
                    clipboard, ready to paste. Highlight text with v and delete
                    simply by pressing d.<br /><br />
                    You can also delete the current line using dd, delete from
                    the current line to the beginnig of the file with dg, and
                    delete from the current line to the end of the file with dG.
                </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>
                    y<br />
                    yank
                </td>
                <td>
                    yank is the same as copy. Highlight text with v and then
                    copy the text with y. yy, yg, yG behave the same way as
                    dd, dg, dG, but yanking instead of deleting.
                </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>
                    p<br />
                    paste
                </td>
                <td>
                    paste from the clipboard: paste whatever you last yanked
                    with y or cut with d. p pastes ahead of the cursor, P pastes
                    behind the cursor.
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        You must remember to change between modes. When you're in insert mode,
        finish typing and then press escape to return to command mode and
        then save.<br /><br />

        vim can be customised with a file named .vimrc in your home directory.
        <br /><br />

        We will discuss how to set up the vimrc file during the course, but if
        you didn't manage to get it working, download
        <a href='{{ root_url }}/vim/.vimrc'>this file</a> as <code>.vimrc</code>
        in your home directory.
